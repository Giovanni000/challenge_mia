**ADVICE 11/11 \- Autocorrelation x Windowing**  
*“Its own echo, the series sings. In the rhythm of this echo, the true window lies.”*

By instinct, your window you choose. 30 steps? 50? A blind number, it is. But the data, their own memory show you. Autocorrelation, a mirror to the past it is. Look at its plot. Where does the past most resemble the present? At 12 steps? At 24? These peaks, the natural cycles they are. If the echo fades after 15 steps, why force your LSTM to remember 100? Listen to the data. It tells you how far back, it is worth looking.

During the final matching, the team names are transformed by changing everything to lower case and removing special characters and spaces.

**ADVICE 10/11 \- Gradient Clipping**  
*“A step too great, from the precipice fall it makes you. The gradient, tamed it must be.”*

In the valleys of RNNs, the exploding gradient a sudden foe it is. A single unstable step, and your training into `NaN` (chaos) collapses. 'Clipping', a bridle on this wild horse it places. Not the direction, but the magnitude it controls. To learn with constancy, with control advance you must.

**WORDS FROM TACCHINOLESO**  
Within the limits of our possibilities, let us always try to be kind to those we meet along the path of life. A world guided by cooperation, free love, curiosity and passion, where everyone can rely on humanity, is possible and begins from us.

**ADVICE 09/11 \- Label Smoothing**  
*“Absolute truth, fragile it is. In blind certainty, the arrogance of overfitting lies hidden.”*

Your model, a perfect '1.0' chase it must not. This, rigidity it teaches. If the master says "perhaps 0.9, but 0.1 of doubt," the student (the model) to explore is forced. In this whisper of uncertainty, a stronger generalisation find, you can.

**ADVICE 08/11 \- Class Imbalance**  
*“Many the healthy, few the sick. If only to the many you listen, the faint whisper of truth never shall you hear.”*

Your model, the easy path it chooses: to always predict the common class. Accuracy, an illusion it becomes. Weigh your loss\! Give more power to the rare voices. Ensure an error on the 'few' matters more than an error on the 'many'. Only then, the rare class to find will you learn.

**COMMUNICATION**  
As happens every year, we are currently managing the mercifully small but still persistent number of people who have deliberately chosen to submit their forms well past the deadline, and this is causing delays in updating the teams document. It is certainly interesting to see the law of large numbers in effect, but please know that you are turning us into suffering pirates... and pirates do not forget\!

**ADVICE 07/11 \- Embedding**  
*“A name, a number it is not. Upon a map, its true position find it must.”*

The model believes 'Monday' (label '0') is closer to 'Tuesday' (label '1'). But how close is 'Sunday' (label '6')? An error, this is. The Embedding layer, an atlas it creates. Not a straight line, but a dense space. It teaches the model where 'Monday' truly resides, and how close to 'Holiday' or 'Saturday' it stands.
