Dear Students,

We have reached the midpoint of the course, and I am deeply proud to note your continued interest and progress. It is both an honour for me and, at the same time, a great responsibility to share the knowledge of this subject with you, and I hope you will become as passionate about it as I am.

This is a remarkable moment in history, and I firmly believe that this technology can do a lot of good for everyone – if used properly and ethically.

In light of this, and of all that lies ahead – in life, but also and especially on this course – I have decided to share, with those of you who might be interested, some digital experiences that have, in their own way, enriched my life.

These are three Spotify playlists that I have created for you and will update each day during the challenge:

I wish you good luck for this first challenge\!

Cordially,

**ADVICE 15/11 \- Data Cleaning**  
*“Every column, a path it promises. But some paths, only into the fog they lead.”*

Have you looked at your data, before bestowing it upon the model? Or blind, have you fed it everything? Perhaps one column, the same value always repeats (zero variance). What guide can this be? Perhaps two columns, the very same song they sing (high correlation). Why carry twice the weight? And that one row, so different from all others... an error, or a rare jewel is it? Not all that you see, is signal. To separate the wheat from the chaff, this the first duty of the wise it is.

---

**ADVICE 14/11 \- Attention**  
*“Not all steps in time, equal weight do they carry. What is important, the model must learn to see.”*

Your LSTM, long memory it has. But does it remember the vital first step, when it reaches the last? Attention, a torch in the long corridor of time it is. It teaches the network *where* to look. It gives more weight to the critical moments. In this focus, great power find you can.

---

**ADVICE 13/11 \- 1D Convolutions**  
*“A pattern in time, like a pattern in space it is. With a new eye, look you must.”*

The Conv2D upon images observes; the Conv1D across sequences scans. The same rules of kernel, padding, and stride, they obey. How might this eye for local patterns, your recurrent network assist? Before the RNN's memory processes the past, the CNN can find the shape.

**WORDS FROM TACCHINOLESO**  
We are constantly influenced by our surroundings, and it is essential to nourish our minds with the right information. For this challenge, I offer you an almost inexhaustible source of ideas. I hope it will give you everything it has to offer: [https://youtu.be/zWq65etOM-M?si=OROl\_e75iZ\_hAlRr](https://youtu.be/zWq65etOM-M?si=OROl_e75iZ_hAlRr)

**ADVICE 12/11 \- Time Feature Engineering**  
“Not only *what* happens, but *when*. Time, not just an index, but a feature it is.”

Your signal, bare it is. But the 'when', rich context it gives. Is it the hour of the day? The day of the week? The start of the month? These are not numbers, but cycles. Transform this 'hour' into a feature. And if it is a category ('Monday'), in the embedding space, its true meaning let it learn.

---

**ADVICE 11/11 \- Autocorrelation x Windowing**  
*“Its own echo, the series sings. In the rhythm of this echo, the true window lies.”*

By instinct, your window you choose. 30 steps? 50? A blind number, it is. But the data, their own memory show you. Autocorrelation, a mirror to the past it is. Look at its plot. Where does the past most resemble the present? At 12 steps? At 24? These peaks, the natural cycles they are. If the echo fades after 15 steps, why force your LSTM to remember 100? Listen to the data. It tells you how far back, it is worth looking.

**COMMUNICATION**  
During the final matching, the team names are transformed by changing everything to lower case and removing special characters and spaces.

---

**ADVICE 10/11 \- Gradient Clipping**  
*“A step too great, from the precipice fall it makes you. The gradient, tamed it must be.”*

In the valleys of RNNs, the exploding gradient a sudden foe it is. A single unstable step, and your training into `NaN` (chaos) collapses. 'Clipping', a bridle on this wild horse it places. Not the direction, but the magnitude it controls. To learn with constancy, with control advance you must.

---

**WORDS FROM TACCHINOLESO**  
Within the limits of our possibilities, let us always try to be kind to those we meet along the path of life. A world guided by cooperation, free love, curiosity and passion, where everyone can rely on humanity, is possible and begins from us.

---

**ADVICE 09/11 \- Label Smoothing**  
*“Absolute truth, fragile it is. In blind certainty, the arrogance of overfitting lies hidden.”*

Your model, a perfect '1.0' chase it must not. This, rigidity it teaches. If the master says "perhaps 0.9, but 0.1 of doubt," the student (the model) to explore is forced. In this whisper of uncertainty, a stronger generalisation find, you can.

**ADVICE 08/11 \- Class Imbalance**  
*“Many the healthy, few the sick. If only to the many you listen, the faint whisper of truth never shall you hear.”*

Your model, the easy path it chooses: to always predict the common class. Accuracy, an illusion it becomes. Weigh your loss\! Give more power to the rare voices. Ensure an error on the 'few' matters more than an error on the 'many'. Only then, the rare class to find will you learn.

---

**COMMUNICATION**  
As happens every year, we are currently managing the mercifully small but still persistent number of people who have deliberately chosen to submit their forms well past the deadline, and this is causing delays in updating the teams document. It is certainly interesting to see the law of large numbers in effect, but please know that you are turning us into suffering pirates... and pirates do not forget\!

---

**ADVICE 07/11 \- Embedding**  
*“A name, a number it is not. Upon a map, its true position find it must.”*

The model believes 'Monday' (label '0') is closer to 'Tuesday' (label '1'). But how close is 'Sunday' (label '6')? An error, this is. The Embedding layer, an atlas it creates. Not a straight line, but a dense space. It teaches the model where 'Monday' truly resides, and how close to 'Holiday' or 'Saturday' it stands.
